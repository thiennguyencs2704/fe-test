# Skedulo Tech Test

## Overview

Hi! Thank you for taking your time to review my answer. I would like to share some of my thinking about the test:

- When I did the test, I didn't know whether I could change some code of the test a little or not but I decided to do it because I thought it is necessary in order to make sure variables have correct types and results are returned correctly.
- I added the 3 following features to the test:

  - Triggering the search function once users stop typing an amount of time.
  - A button to search all jobs.
  - A helper function to format date.

- If you have any question about my answer, please let me know!
